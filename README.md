The goals for xproc tutorial are manifold and wondrous.

First we want to provide a high quality tutorial that will be an entry point to learning XProc in both the first five minutes and first day scenariosg. 

Secondly we want to provide a reference publishing workflow usage of XProc for publishing books on github using docbook.

workflow
* author tutorial in docbook, commit
* generate asciidoc (or markdown) for publishing directly to github
* generate pdf, html etc targets 
* enable continuous publishing workflow with github

ideas
* other targets (saxon-ce help)
* xquerydoc in docbook ?
