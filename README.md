tutorial
========

The goals for xproc tutorial are manifold.

First we want to provide a high quality tutorial that will be the entry point to learning XProc. 

Secondly we want to provide a reference implementation of xproc for publishing books on github.

* author tutorial in docbook
* generate asciidoc (or markdown) for publishing directly to github
* generate pdf, html etc targets 
* define continuous publishing workflow with github

Ideas
* other targets - saxon-ce help 
* xquerydoc in docbook ?
